## Data Used

This project uses two datasets available at the following link: [Amazon Books Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews). Due to size limitations, these datasets are not included within the repository.

To use this project, please download the two datasets from the link above and rename them as follows:
- `books_data.csv`
- `Books_rating.csv`

Place these files in the directory `preprocessing/data` to ensure compatibility with the project structure.

Next, preprocess the data using `Preprocess_data.ipynb`. This notebook will process the raw data into the final datasets used in the application.
